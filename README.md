# hello-world
This is new

Today is 6/17/2018 and I am on my secondish week of summer break of my Senior Year

I look forward to the future but I'll miss my friends in highschool, I hope I see them again one day
Anyways I wanted to get into GitHub to introduce me into a bit of code, maybe I'll pick up something that I'll like here.
